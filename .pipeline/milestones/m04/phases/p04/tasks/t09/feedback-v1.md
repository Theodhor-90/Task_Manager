{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan-v1.md file does not contain an actual implementation plan — it contains a message about a blocked write permission followed by a brief summary. A lockable plan must be a complete, structured document. Specific issues:\n\n1. **No plan document exists**: The file content is a conversational message (\"It seems the write permission is being blocked...\") with bullet-point notes, not a structured plan. The plan must be rewritten as an actual implementation specification.\n\n2. **Missing step-by-step modification details for board-view.tsx**: The plan must specify exactly what imports are added, what state variables are introduced, where `FilterBar` is rendered in the JSX, how `filteredTasks` is derived (full filter logic with `useMemo`), how the column rendering changes from `tasks` to `filteredTasks`, and how `taskCount` is handled (the summary says \"column task count badge shows unfiltered count\" but doesn't specify implementation).\n\n3. **Incorrect @dnd-kit API for disabling reorder**: The summary says `SortableContext disabled={{ droppable: true }}` but `SortableContext` does not accept a `disabled` prop. The correct approach is to pass `disabled: true` to `useSortable()` in `SortableTaskItem`, or to conditionally omit drag listeners. The plan must specify the exact, correct @dnd-kit API usage — likely passing a `disabled` prop to `SortableTaskItem` and using it in the `useSortable({ disabled })` call.\n\n4. **Missing handleDragEnd guard specification**: The summary mentions a \"belt-and-suspenders guard in handleDragEnd to skip same-column reorders when filters active\" but doesn't specify how `handleDragEnd` accesses the filter state (it's a function inside `BoardView` so it can access local state, but this needs to be explicit).\n\n5. **Missing test plan details**: \"14 new tests\" are mentioned but none are listed. The plan must enumerate each test case with its name, what it asserts, and the mock/setup requirements. Tests must cover: (a) FilterBar renders above columns, (b) each filter type hides non-matching tasks, (c) AND logic across filter types, (d) clearing filters restores all tasks, (e) drag reorder disabled when filters active, (f) cross-column drag still works with filters, (g) visual indicator appears when filters active, (h) column add/reorder unaffected by filters, (i) task count shows unfiltered count.\n\n6. **Missing FilterState import and integration details**: The existing `FilterBar` at `filter-bar.tsx` exports `FilterState` and expects `onFilterChange`, `totalCount`, and `filteredCount` props. The plan must show the exact state initialization in `BoardView` and how `onFilterChange` updates it.\n\n7. **Missing specification for \"tasks without dueDate excluded when date filter active\"**: This is a design decision mentioned in the summary but needs explicit filter logic (e.g., `if (filters.dueDateFrom || filters.dueDateTo) { if (!task.dueDate) return false; }`).\n\nRewrite plan-v1.md as a complete, structured implementation plan with all the above details specified explicitly enough that every line of code can be written from the plan alone."}
