{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan's Test Plan section (Section 5, \"Phase 4 exit criteria checklist\") is inaccurate for items 1-3 (comment CRUD). It claims these are verified by `task-detail-panel.test.tsx` and `comment-list.tsx structure`, but:\n\n1. `task-detail-panel.test.tsx` contains zero comment-related tests (no imports, no assertions, no mentions of \"comment\" at all).\n2. There are no `comment-list.test.tsx` or `comment-form.test.tsx` test files in the client test suite.\n3. Referencing \"comment-list.tsx structure\" is not a test — it's a code review at best.\n\n**Fix required**: Update the exit criteria checklist rows for items 1-3 to honestly state that there are no automated client-side tests for comment CRUD. These criteria can only be verified through TypeScript compilation (Step 3 confirms the components compile) and manual dev-server inspection (Step 6). The plan should note this as a known gap inherited from Tasks 1-2, and optionally add a spot-check in Section 7 to grep for comment component rendering in `task-detail-panel.tsx` to at least confirm integration wiring. Do not claim test coverage that doesn't exist."}
