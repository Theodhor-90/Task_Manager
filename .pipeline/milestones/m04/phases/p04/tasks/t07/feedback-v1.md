{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan file (`plan-v1.md`) does not contain an actual implementation plan. It contains only a brief summary (15 lines) ending with \"Could you grant write permission so I can save the plan file?\" — indicating the plan was developed in conversation but never written to the file. The file must contain the complete plan before it can be reviewed and locked.\n\nSpecifically, the plan is missing all of the following (compare to the Task 6 locked plan format):\n\n1. **Deliverables table** — A table listing each file, action (Created/Modified), and purpose.\n\n2. **Dependencies section** — Explicit references to the context methods (`addLabel`, `updateLabel`, `removeLabel` at board-context.tsx), the `ConfirmDialog` component (at `components/ui/confirm-dialog.tsx`), the `LabelPicker` placeholder (lines 110-123 of label-picker.tsx), and the `Label` type from `@taskboard/shared`.\n\n3. **Implementation Details for each deliverable**:\n   - **`label-manager.tsx`**: Full component code or detailed specification including: props interface (needs an `onClose` callback at minimum), component structure, state management (`editingId`, new label form state), the create form JSX, the label list with inline edit mode, delete with ConfirmDialog, random color generation logic, styling (Tailwind classes matching codebase conventions), and how it handles empty states.\n   - **`label-picker.tsx` modification**: Exact description of what replaces the placeholder at lines 110-123 — importing `LabelManager` and rendering it conditionally when `showManager` is true, passing `onClose={() => setShowManager(false)}`.\n   - **`label-manager.test.tsx`**: All 13 test cases need to be specified with test names, mock setup, and assertions — not just a count.\n\n4. **Contracts section** — Props interface for `LabelManager`, context dependencies, and rendering behavior for key states (empty labels list, edit mode active, creating a new label).\n\n5. **Test Plan** — The summary mentions \"13 tests covering all CRUD operations, keyboard shortcuts, error handling, and state transitions\" but none are enumerated. Each test case needs a name and description of what it verifies.\n\n6. **Implementation Order** — Step-by-step sequence for creating/modifying files.\n\n7. **Verification Commands** — Shell commands for building, type-checking, and running tests.\n\n**Action required**: Write the full plan to `plan-v1.md` with all sections above populated. The plan must be detailed enough that every file can be written from the plan alone, with no guesswork."}
