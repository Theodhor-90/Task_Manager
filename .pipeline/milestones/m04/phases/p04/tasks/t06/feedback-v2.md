{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The `handleToggle` function in `LabelPicker` lacks error handling. The existing `TaskDetailPanel` handlers (`handlePriorityChange` at line 153, `handleDueDateChange` at line 165, `handleClearDueDate` at line 180) all wrap `updateTask` calls in try/catch. The plan's `handleToggle` calls `await updateTask(...)` and `onUpdate(...)` without any try/catch. If the API call fails, this produces an unhandled promise rejection and the checkbox visual state becomes inconsistent (the user clicked it, but the change wasn't persisted and `onUpdate` was never called to sync state). Add a try/catch around the toggle logic — on failure, either silently ignore (matching the priority/due-date pattern) or show brief feedback. Also add a test case for the error scenario (e.g., \"does not call onUpdate when updateTask rejects\")."}
