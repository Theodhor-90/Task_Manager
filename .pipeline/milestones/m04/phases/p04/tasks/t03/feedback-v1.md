The plan is **approved**. It is precise, complete, and ready to lock:

- **Single file deliverable** with full verbatim content provided — zero ambiguity
- **Exact pattern match** with existing API client modules (`comments.ts`, `tasks.ts`, `projects.ts`)
- **No shared type changes needed** — `Label` and `ApiSuccessResponse` already exist
- **No over-engineering** — exactly four functions, nothing extra
- **Verification commands** match the spec's stated exit criteria (TypeScript compilation + export check)
- **No contradictions** with the phase spec, milestone spec, or master plan endpoint definitions
