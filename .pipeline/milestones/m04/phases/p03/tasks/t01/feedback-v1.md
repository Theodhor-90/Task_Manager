The plan is straightforward and complete for what is essentially a single `npm install` task. It correctly identifies the exact command to run, lists what NOT to do (no extra plugins, no type packages, no code changes), and provides a thorough verification checklist covering package.json inspection, workspace resolution, build, and test regression. There are no ambiguities, no over-engineering, no contradictions with the spec, and the plan is clearly feasible.
