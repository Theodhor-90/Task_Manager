{"feedback":"Implementation is complete and correct. The `fetchTask` function has been added to `packages/client/src/api/tasks.ts` (lines 26-30) following the exact pattern specified in the locked plan. All verification commands passed: function is exported, TypeScript compiles successfully, and all 231 tests pass with no regressions. The implementation follows CRUD ordering conventions, requires no additional imports, and matches the specification's exit criteria perfectly.","verdict":"approved","issues":[]}
