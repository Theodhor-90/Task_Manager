{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan-v1.md file does not contain an actual implementation plan. It contains a message about write permissions followed by a brief summary. The file must be rewritten as a full implementation plan matching the format and detail level of the locked plans for t01–t04. Specifically, the plan must include:\n\n1. **Deliverables table** — List `packages/client/src/components/board-view.tsx` (Created) and `packages/client/src/components/__tests__/board-view.test.tsx` (Created) with clear purpose descriptions.\n\n2. **Dependencies section** — Explicitly list: Task 3 (BoardContext with `useBoard` hook returning `board`, `tasks`, `isLoading`, `error`, `loadBoard`, `addColumn`, `reorderColumns`, `renameColumn`, `removeColumn`), Task 4 (Column component with its exact props interface: `column`, `taskCount`, `onRename`, `onDelete`, `children`), existing UI components (`LoadingSpinner`, `ErrorMessage`), and `@dnd-kit` packages (already installed from t01).\n\n3. **Full implementation details for `board-view.tsx`** — Include:\n   - Complete import list (react, @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, @taskboard/shared types, useBoard, Column, LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage)\n   - The complete component structure with all state variables (`isAddingColumn`, `newColumnName`)\n   - Task grouping logic: `tasks.filter(t => t.status === column.name).sort((a, b) => a.position - b.position)`\n   - DndContext setup with `closestCenter` collision detection, `PointerSensor` (with `distance: 8` activation constraint), and `KeyboardSensor`\n   - `SortableContext` with `horizontalListSortingStrategy` using column `_id`s as items\n   - Complete `handleDragEnd` implementation using `arrayMove` from `@dnd-kit/sortable`\n   - \"Add Column\" inline form implementation with Enter/Escape keyboard handling\n   - How each Column is rendered with props wired to context methods\n   - Task stubs rendered as `<div>` children inside each Column\n   - Complete JSX template with Tailwind classes (horizontal `flex overflow-x-auto gap-4 p-4` container, etc.)\n\n4. **Full implementation details for `board-view.test.tsx`** — Include:\n   - Mock setup for `useBoard` (mock the `../context/board-context` module), `@dnd-kit/core` (DndContext, closestCenter, PointerSensor, KeyboardSensor, useSensor, useSensors), `@dnd-kit/sortable` (SortableContext, horizontalListSortingStrategy, arrayMove)\n   - Mock data: mock board with columns, mock tasks with status/position fields\n   - Render helper function\n   - Every test case written out with full code, covering: loading state (shows LoadingSpinner), error state (shows ErrorMessage), null board (renders nothing), columns render with correct names, task count passed correctly to Column, tasks grouped by status and sorted by position, Add Column button toggles inline form, Enter submits new column name and calls addColumn, Escape cancels add column form, empty input does not call addColumn, DndContext and SortableContext are rendered, handleDragEnd calls reorderColumns with correct column order\n\n5. **Contracts section** — Show how BoardPage (t06) will wrap this component in BoardProvider, and how the component interfaces with BoardContext.\n\n6. **Implementation order** — Numbered steps: create board-view.tsx, create board-view.test.tsx, verify TypeScript compilation, run board-view tests, run all client tests.\n\n7. **Verification commands** — Bash commands to verify file existence, exports, TypeScript compilation, and test execution."}
