{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan proposes changing `CSS.Transform.toString(transform)` to `CSS.Translate.toString(transform)` in `SortableTaskItem` (Section 3.6, Step 2), but does NOT update the test mock in `board-view.test.tsx`. The current mock (lines 65-71) only provides `CSS.Transform.toString`:\n\n```typescript\nvi.mock(\"@dnd-kit/utilities\", () => ({\n  CSS: {\n    Transform: {\n      toString: () => undefined,\n    },\n  },\n}));\n```\n\nAfter the production code change, `CSS.Translate` would be `undefined` in the test environment, causing a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')` in every test that renders `SortableTaskItem` (which includes the existing board-view tests and the new integration tests).\n\n**Fix**: In Section 3.2 (new tests) or Section 3.6 (visual polish), add an explicit step to update the `@dnd-kit/utilities` mock to include `CSS.Translate.toString`:\n\n```typescript\nvi.mock(\"@dnd-kit/utilities\", () => ({\n  CSS: {\n    Translate: {\n      toString: () => undefined,\n    },\n  },\n}));\n```\n\n(The `Transform` key can be removed since it will no longer be used, or kept for safety — either way, `Translate` must be present.)\n\nEverything else in the plan is solid: the gap analysis is accurate, the circular reference fix from v1 feedback is correctly addressed, test patterns match existing infrastructure, visual polish is appropriate, and verification criteria align with the task spec."}
