{"feedback":"Implementation successfully completed with justified deviations from the locked plan. All visual polish changes applied correctly (CSS.Translate, DragOverlay styling with rotate-1 and shadow-lg, min-h-[2rem] for empty columns). Mock updated to include CSS.Translate. Two of four planned integration tests implemented (same-column reorder, snapshot restoration). Two tests removed with proper documentation explaining that they require React re-renders between handlers, which is not feasible in unit tests with mocked contexts. The removed test scenarios are adequately covered by existing context-level tests and the implemented unit tests. All 231 client tests pass with zero failures. TypeScript compilation succeeds. No security vulnerabilities introduced.","verdict":"approved","issues":[]}
