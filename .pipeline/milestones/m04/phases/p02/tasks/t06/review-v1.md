{"feedback":"Implementation is nearly complete with all visual polish applied and 3 of 4 new integration tests passing. However, there is a critical bug in the \"empty column area drop\" test - the test mock doesn't properly simulate React state snapshots, causing the snapshot and current state to share the same array reference. This prevents proper testing of the cross-column drop on empty column feature. The production code logic appears sound, but the test needs to be fixed to properly capture independent snapshots before state mutations.","verdict":"needs_revision","issues":[{"file":"packages/client/src/components/__tests__/board-view.test.tsx","description":"Test 'handleDragEnd calls moveTask when task dropped on empty column area' fails because the mockSetTasks implementation causes tasksSnapshot.current to reference the same array as updatedTasks. When onDragOver mutates updatedTasks, the snapshot also changes, so the snapshot restore in onDragEnd doesn't actually restore anything. The test needs to ensure the snapshot is captured as an independent copy before mutations occur."}]}
