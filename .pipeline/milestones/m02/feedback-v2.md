Only one issue needs to be fixed before locking:\n\n**Remove the preamble scratchpad text (lines 1–10).** The file begins with leftover reasoning notes (\"Now I have all the context I need. The feedback is straightforward — the endpoint count in Exit Criterion #1 is wrong...\"). The actual spec starts at line 12. Delete lines 1–10 so the file begins cleanly with `# Milestone 2: Core API — Specification`."}
