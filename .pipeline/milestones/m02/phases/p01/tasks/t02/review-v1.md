{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Verified: `project.routes.ts` includes `GET /:id` and `PUT /:id` with ObjectId validation, owner scoping, correct 400/404/200 behavior, and whitelisted update fields; `mongoose.test-double.ts` includes `findOneAndUpdate` with `{ new: true }` behavior; `project.routes.test.ts` includes the planned GET/PUT integration coverage (including extraneous-field protection). All locked-plan verification commands passed (`npm run build`, full tests, and targeted Vitest runs). No new OWASP Top 10 issues were identified in the implemented changes."  , "issues":[]}
