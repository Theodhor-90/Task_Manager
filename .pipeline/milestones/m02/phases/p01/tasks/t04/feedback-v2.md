**Verdict: Approved**

The plan is ready to lock. It correctly identifies this as a verify-only task, provides precise line-number mappings from all 6 spec deliverables to existing tests in the file, and the test count (31) is accurate. The v1 feedback issues — stale premise, no concrete mapping, vague implementation order, missing spec/supplementary distinction — are all resolved in v2.
