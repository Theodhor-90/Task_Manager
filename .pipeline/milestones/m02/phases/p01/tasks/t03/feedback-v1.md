{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan file (`plan-v1.md`) does not contain an actual implementation plan. Its contents are a message about write permissions being denied, mentioning what the plan *would* cover but never actually providing it. The file needs to be rewritten with the complete plan including:\n\n1. **Test-double modifications**: Exact code changes needed for `$in` operator support in the `matches` function and the missing `deleteOne` method — specify which file(s), what the current code looks like, and what the new code should be.\n2. **DELETE handler implementation**: The full handler code or pseudocode to be added to `project.routes.ts`, including all model imports, ObjectId validation, ownership check, cascade delete sequence (Comments → Tasks → Labels → Board → Project), and response shape.\n3. **Integration tests**: All 6+ test cases with descriptions, setup requirements (what seed data each test needs), exact HTTP calls, and assertion details.\n4. **File manifest**: List of all files to create or modify with the specific changes for each.\n\nThe task spec itself is clear and well-defined — the plan just needs to actually be written to the file."}
