The plan is **approved**. 

The plan correctly identifies this as a verify-only task — all 13 spec-required tests (4 validation errors, 3 not-found cases, 5 unauthorized checks, and 1 cascade delete verification) are already present in the test file from earlier tasks (t01–t03). The plan provides a precise mapping from each spec requirement to the exact test with line numbers, and the implementation is simply running the test suite to confirm everything passes. I verified the claims against the actual test file and they are all accurate.
