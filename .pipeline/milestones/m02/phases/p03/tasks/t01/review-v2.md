{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. `task.routes.ts` contains the required validators and both exported route plugins with 501 stubs, `app.ts` imports/registers both plugins with correct prefixes, TypeScript/build/tests all pass (`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build --workspace=packages/server`, `cd packages/server && npm test`), and route registration is confirmed via `app.printRoutes()` including `/api/boards/:boardId/tasks` and `/api/tasks/:id` + `/move`. Security review found no new OWASP-top-10 issues in this scaffold task. Note: direct port-binding startup verification is blocked in this sandbox (`EPERM`), but in-process app construction succeeds.","issues":[]}
