{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan file `.pipeline/milestones/m02/phases/p03/tasks/t05/plan-v1.md` does not contain an implementation plan. Its entire content is a message asking for write permission: \"It looks like I need write permission to save the plan file. Could you grant write permission so I can save the implementation plan to `.pipeline/milestones/m02/phases/p03/tasks/t05/plan.md`?\" An actual implementation plan must be written before it can be reviewed and locked. The plan should cover: (1) the exact code to add to `task.routes.ts` for the `PUT /:id/move` handler, (2) the specific reindexing algorithm with Mongoose operations, (3) how cross-column vs within-column moves are distinguished and handled, (4) position clamping logic, and (5) error handling paths — all with enough detail to implement directly from the plan."}
