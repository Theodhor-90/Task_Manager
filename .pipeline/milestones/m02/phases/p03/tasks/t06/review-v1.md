{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Both planned files are present and correctly updated (`packages/server/test/helpers/mongoose.test-double.ts`, `packages/server/test/routes/task.routes.test.ts`), endpoint coverage aligns with the required suites/cases, and all verification commands passed: `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, focused vitest runs for task/project/board routes, and `npm run build --workspace=packages/server`. No new OWASP-relevant security risks were introduced (changes are confined to test infrastructure/tests). Code style is consistent with existing test conventions.","issues":[]}
