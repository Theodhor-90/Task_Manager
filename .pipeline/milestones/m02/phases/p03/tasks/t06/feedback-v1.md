{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan is well-structured and covers the vast majority of requirements correctly. However, there is one critical gap and a few minor issues:\n\n**CRITICAL: Missing test-double support for array-contains matching (label filter will break)**\n\nThe task list endpoint uses `filter.labels = label` (line 195 of `task.routes.ts`) to filter tasks by label ID. In real Mongoose, querying `{ labels: \"someId\" }` on an array field implicitly checks if any element in the array matches (array-contains semantics). However, the test double's `matches` function at line 104 does `normalizeForCompare(doc[key]) === normalizeForCompare(value)` — when `doc.labels` is an array like `[\"abc123\"]`, `normalizeForCompare` returns a new array `[\"abc123\"]`, which will never `===` the string `\"abc123\"`. This means **all label filter tests will fail** with the current test double.\n\nThe plan must add array-contains matching support to the test double's `matches` function. When the filter value is a plain scalar and the document field is an array, the comparison should check if any element in the array matches the filter value (mimicking Mongoose's implicit `$elemMatch` behavior). Add this to Section 3.1 alongside the `$ne` and `$gte` additions. Suggested location: in the `matches` function, before the final `return` statement at line 104, add:\n\n```typescript\nconst docVal = normalizeForCompare(doc[key]);\nconst filterVal = normalizeForCompare(value);\nif (Array.isArray(docVal) && !Array.isArray(filterVal)) {\n  return (docVal as unknown[]).some((item) => item === filterVal);\n}\nreturn docVal === filterVal;\n```\n\n**MINOR: Two small items**\n\n1. Section 3.2.1 imports `CommentModel` and `LabelModel` from `../../src/models/index.js` — good. But the import list should also include `BoardModel` if position verification tests plan to fetch tasks via the model directly (some delete/move tests may benefit from `TaskModel.find()` for direct position checking rather than relying solely on the API endpoint). Currently the plan uses the API `getTasks` helper for this, which is fine and consistent — just confirm this is intentional and sufficient for all position assertions.\n\n2. Suite 2, test #6 (sorts by createdAt ascending): The plan says \"create tasks with delay between them\" but the test double likely uses `Date.now()` which may produce identical timestamps if tasks are created in rapid succession. Consider explicitly setting distinct `createdAt` values via a brief `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 10))` between creates, or acknowledge that the test double's auto-generated timestamps should differ because each `create` call assigns a new `Date()`. Verify this works in practice."}
