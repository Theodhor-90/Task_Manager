## Review Summary

**Verdict: NEEDS_REVISION**

The implementation is incomplete. The primary deliverable—`packages/server/test/routes/label.routes.test.ts`—does not exist in the filesystem, despite the implementation notes claiming it was created.

**Issue Found:**
- **File**: `packages/server/test/routes/label.routes.test.ts`
- **Description**: File does not exist. This is the primary deliverable of Task 5 - a complete integration test suite for all label endpoints with 23 test cases as specified in the locked plan.

The task specification and locked plan both clearly define this test file as the sole deliverable. Without it, the task cannot be marked as complete. The route handlers from Task 2 exist and are properly registered, but they remain untested.
