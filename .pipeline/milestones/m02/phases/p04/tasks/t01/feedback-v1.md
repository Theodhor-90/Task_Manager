**Verdict: Approved**

The plan is ready to lock. It is thorough, unambiguous, and fully aligned with both the task spec and established codebase conventions. Key strengths:

- **Exact pattern compliance**: All Mongoose type assertions, validation functions, request param casting, and response envelopes match verified codebase patterns
- **Complete authorization chains**: Both task-scoped and comment-scoped auth flows are fully specified
- **No over-engineering**: Stays within task scope, correctly defers app.ts registration to Task 3 and tests to Task 4
- **Zero contradictions**: Consistent with master plan, milestone spec, and phase spec
- **Implementation-ready**: Every detail is specified — imports, function signatures, response shapes, error messages — no guesswork needed
