{"feedback":"The implementation is incomplete. The src/app.ts file is missing the required imports and route registrations specified in the locked plan. While the comment.routes.ts and label.routes.ts files exist and are correctly implemented (from tasks 1 and 2), they have not been wired into the Fastify application. The file needs two import statements and four app.register() calls to expose the eight new endpoints.","verdict":"needs_revision","issues":[{"file":"packages/server/src/app.ts","description":"Missing import statement: import { taskCommentRoutes, commentRoutes } from \"./routes/comment.routes.js\"; (should be added after line 9)"},{"file":"packages/server/src/app.ts","description":"Missing import statement: import { projectLabelRoutes, labelRoutes } from \"./routes/label.routes.js\"; (should be added after line 9)"},{"file":"packages/server/src/app.ts","description":"Missing route registration: await app.register(taskCommentRoutes, { prefix: \"/api/tasks\" }); (should be added after line 29)"},{"file":"packages/server/src/app.ts","description":"Missing route registration: await app.register(commentRoutes, { prefix: \"/api/comments\" }); (should be added after line 29)"},{"file":"packages/server/src/app.ts","description":"Missing route registration: await app.register(projectLabelRoutes, { prefix: \"/api/projects\" }); (should be added after line 29)"},{"file":"packages/server/src/app.ts","description":"Missing route registration: await app.register(labelRoutes, { prefix: \"/api/labels\" }); (should be added after line 29)"}]}
