{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. The `PUT /api/boards/:boardId/columns/:columnId` route is implemented with the required validations, ownership checks, 400/401/404/200 behaviors, and non-cascading status behavior. Test coverage includes all planned cases (10 new PUT tests), and verification commands passed: `npx vitest run test/routes/board.routes.test.ts` (24/24), `npx vitest run` (124/124), and `npx tsc --noEmit` (success). No OWASP Top 10 issues were introduced by these changes based on code inspection."  , "issues":[]}
