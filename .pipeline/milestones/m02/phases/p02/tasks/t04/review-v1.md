{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Verified `DELETE /api/boards/:boardId/columns/:columnId` behavior in `packages/server/src/routes/board.routes.ts` (ObjectId validation, ownership check, task guard via `TaskModel.countDocuments`, delete + reindex, correct responses) and confirmed the 10 planned DELETE tests are present in `packages/server/test/routes/board.routes.test.ts`. Verification commands all passed: `npx vitest run test/routes/board.routes.test.ts` (34/34), `npx vitest run` (134/134), and `npx tsc --noEmit`. No new OWASP Top 10 concerns identified from this change; auth, input validation, and resource-ownership checks are in place."  , "issues": []}
