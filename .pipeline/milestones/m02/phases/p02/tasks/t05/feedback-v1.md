The plan is **approved** and ready to lock.

The plan is thorough, unambiguous, and implementation-ready:
- Complete route handler code with exact validation logic and error messages
- Critical route registration ordering correctly addressed (reorder before `:columnId`)
- 12 well-specified tests covering all 8 verification criteria from the task spec
- Fully consistent with existing codebase patterns (type guards, ownership verification, save/toJSON casting, test infrastructure)
- No over-engineering or scope creep beyond the task spec requirements
