{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and spec: `board.routes.ts` was added with `GET /:projectId/board` + `columnRoutes` stub, `app.ts` registers `boardRoutes` under `/api/projects`, and `board.routes.test.ts` includes the 6 required integration tests. Verification passed: targeted board tests (6/6), full test suite (106/106), and TypeScript check (`npx tsc --noEmit`). `npm run dev` reaches DB connection/seed but cannot bind `0.0.0.0:3001` in this sandbox (`EPERM`), which is environment-related rather than an implementation defect.","issues":[]}
