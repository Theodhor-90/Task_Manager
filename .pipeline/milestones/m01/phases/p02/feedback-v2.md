{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"**BLOCKING: spec-v2.md is again meta-commentary, not an actual specification document.**\n\nThis is the same failure mode identified in feedback-v1. The file is 17 lines of conversational text (\"It looks like write access... Could you grant write permission... Here's a summary of what the revised spec addresses...\"). It contains zero specification content. Despite claiming to address all 7 sections demanded by the feedback, none of those sections actually appear in the file.\n\n**What spec-v2.md contains (all of it is meta-text):**\n- A request for write permission (line 1)\n- A summary of what the feedback said (line 3)\n- A numbered list describing what the spec *would* contain (lines 9-16)\n- A closing statement about having no preamble — which is itself preamble (line 17)\n\n**What spec-v2.md must contain (as rendered markdown, not descriptions of it):**\n\n1. **Goal section** — A `## Goal` heading followed by the actual goal statement for Phase 2\n\n2. **Scope section** — `## Scope` with `### In-Scope` and `### Out-of-Scope` sub-sections containing actual scope bullets\n\n3. **Ordered task list** — `## Tasks` with 8 numbered task sub-sections. Each task must include:\n   - Title and description of what it delivers\n   - Specific file paths (e.g., `packages/server/src/db.ts`)\n   - Schema tables with field names, types, validation rules, and indexes\n   - Dependencies on prior tasks (e.g., \"depends on T1\")\n   - A completion gate (e.g., \"Complete when: `connectDb()` connects successfully and `disconnectDb()` closes cleanly, verified by test\")\n\n4. **Dependencies section** — `## Dependencies` with a prerequisites table (Node, npm, MongoDB, Phase 1 assets), environment variables table with defaults, and npm packages to install\n\n5. **Exit criteria** — `## Exit Criteria` with a numbered or tabular list of 9 measurable criteria, each mapped to master plan exits (MP-3, MP-4, etc.) with verification commands (e.g., \"Run `npm test` in packages/server — all model tests pass\")\n\n6. **Artifact inventory** — `## Artifacts` enumerating every file to create or modify with a one-line description\n\n7. **Technical decisions** — `## Technical Decisions` with rationale for bcryptjs vs bcrypt, pre-save hooks vs utility functions, test DB strategy, etc.\n\n**The document must be self-contained.** A developer should be able to implement the entire phase from spec-v2.md alone. No meta-commentary, no permission requests, no summaries about what the spec would contain. Write the actual spec."}
