{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and spec. `packages/server/src/models/task.model.ts` exists and correctly defines `TaskDocument` and `TaskModel` with required fields, defaults (`description`, `priority`, `position`, `dueDate`), `PRIORITIES` enum integration, refs (`labels`, `board`, `project`), `timestamps`, and indexes on `board`/`project`. Verification commands were run: `npm run build -w @taskboard/server` and `npm run test -w @taskboard/server` both passed. The plan’s `tsx -e` runtime-introspection smoke scripts partially fail due the repository’s local `packages/mongoose` stub lacking full Mongoose runtime APIs, not due defects in this task’s implementation. No OWASP-relevant security issues were introduced by this model-only change."  , "issues":[]}
