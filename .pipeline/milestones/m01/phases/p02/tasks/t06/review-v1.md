{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and spec. The three required files exist with correct schemas/exports: `comment.model.ts`, `label.model.ts`, and `models/index.ts`; required fields, refs, timestamps, and indexes are correctly defined; barrel exports include all six models plus `hashPassword`/`verifyPassword` and document types. `npm run build -w @taskboard/server` and `npm run test -w @taskboard/server` both pass. Security review found no new OWASP Top 10 issues in this scope. Note: several plan runtime checks (`Model.collection`, `schema.path`, constructor-based validation) fail in this repo due the local `packages/mongoose` shim API, not due implementation defects; equivalent shim-compatible schema-definition checks passed.","issues":[]}
