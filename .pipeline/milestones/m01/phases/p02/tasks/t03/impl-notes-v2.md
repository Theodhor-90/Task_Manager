I hit a blocker before editing: [packages/server/package.json](/Users/theodhor/Desktop/Portfolio/Task_Manager/packages/server/package.json) currently contains unresolved merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

Per your repo safety rules, I stopped immediately once I saw unexpected changes. How do you want to proceed?

1. I resolve this conflict now (minimal, task-focused) and continue fixing `t03`.
2. You want to resolve it yourself first, then I continue.
3. I continue only with `project.model.ts` and avoid touching `package.json` unless needed.
