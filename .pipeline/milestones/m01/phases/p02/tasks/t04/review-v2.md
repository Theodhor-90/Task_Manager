{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`board.model.ts` is present and mostly aligns with the task/spec (ObjectId project ref, embedded columns, timestamps, export exists), and both `npm run build -w @taskboard/server` and `npm run test -w @taskboard/server` pass. However, the locked plan’s verification commands do not all pass in this implementation: the model smoke test and validation smoke test fail at runtime due to gaps in the local `mongoose` workspace shim API.","issues":[{"file":"packages/mongoose/index.js","description":"Plan verification command #2 fails: `BoardModel.collection.collectionName` throws because the shim `model()` return value lacks a `collection` object and schema metadata (`schema.paths`) expected by the plan’s smoke test."},{"file":"packages/mongoose/index.js","description":"Plan verification command #4 fails: `mongoose.Types.ObjectId` is undefined because the default export does not expose `Types`. This causes runtime failure before completing the validation check."},{"file":"packages/mongoose/index.d.ts","description":"Type surface is incomplete relative to runtime usage in verification scripts (default mongoose export omits `Types`/`Schema` members), which masks the runtime API mismatch and contributes to failing plan checks."}]}
