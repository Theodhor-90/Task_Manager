{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec: `packages/server/src/seed.ts` and `packages/server/src/server.ts` are correctly implemented, startup order is `connectDb -> seedDefaultUser -> listen`, and seed behavior is idempotent with the specified default admin credentials. All locked-plan verification commands passed (build, import smoke checks, runtime seed/idempotency/password verification, and tests). No new OWASP Top 10-critical issues were introduced for this task scope; the hardcoded default admin credential is spec-required and should remain a known bootstrap risk.","issues":[]}
