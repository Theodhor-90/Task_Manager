{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"Implementation is close, but it does not fully match the locked plan/code conventions: `seed.ts` uses an `unknown` type-cast wrapper around `UserModel` instead of calling `UserModel.countDocuments()` and `UserModel.create()` directly as specified. Build and existing tests pass, but the runtime seed verification command could not be fully validated in this workspace due the local `mongoose` runtime stub lacking standard model methods.","issues":[{"file":"packages/server/src/seed.ts","description":"Remove the `UserModel as unknown as { ... }` cast and call `UserModel.countDocuments()` / `UserModel.create(...)` directly. The cast weakens type safety and deviates from the locked plan’s specified implementation."}]}
