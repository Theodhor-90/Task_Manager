{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`packages/server/src/models/user.model.ts` matches the locked plan/spec, and all listed verification commands execute successfully. However, the implementation introduces out-of-plan dependency shims that invalidate the verification and introduce a security risk.","issues":[{"file":"package.json","description":"Workspace entries were expanded to include local `mongoose`, `bcryptjs`, `@types/bcryptjs`, and `tsx` packages, causing `@taskboard/server` to resolve to local shims instead of real upstream dependencies. This is not in the locked plan and changes runtime behavior globally."},{"file":"packages/bcryptjs/index.js","description":"This is not bcryptjs; it implements SHA-256 with a custom format and a bcrypt-like prefix (`$2a$...`). This is a cryptographic failure (OWASP A02) and does not satisfy the plan/spec requirement to use `bcryptjs` hashing semantics."},{"file":"packages/mongoose/index.js","description":"Local mongoose stub replaces real Mongoose behavior with minimal placeholders (`model` returns a plain object). Required schema/runtime guarantees (validation, unique index behavior, timestamps persistence semantics) are not actually provided, so implementation correctness cannot be trusted."},{"file":"packages/tsx/cli.js","description":"Custom `tsx` shim rewrites `./src/` imports to `./dist/`, which changes what the verification command tests. This makes the smoke checks non-equivalent to the locked-plan verification intent."}]}
