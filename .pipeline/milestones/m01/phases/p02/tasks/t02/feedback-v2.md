{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan is well-structured and addresses the v1 feedback correctly (removed the shared import dependency, clarified design reference). The implementation code, contracts, and verification commands are solid. However, two issues remain:\n\n1. **Conversational preamble still present (line 1)**: The file begins with \"Now I have all the context I need. Let me summarize the feedback and produce the revised plan:\" followed by a multi-line summary of the v1 feedback. This preamble (lines 1-7) is not plan content — it's agent chatter carried over from the generation process. The file should start cleanly at `# Task t02: User Model with Password Hashing — Implementation Plan`. Remove everything before the `#` heading.\n\n2. **Missing task spec file**: There is no `spec.md` in the t02 directory (`.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p02/tasks/t02/`). The t01 task had this same problem and its implementation had to create the spec file as a fix (see `impl-final.md` line 1). The plan should include a step to create `spec.md` for t02 before implementation begins, or at minimum acknowledge this gap. The task spec is the authoritative definition of what this task must deliver — without it, the plan has no anchoring document. Looking at the milestone spec-v1.md Phase 2 deliverable #2, the t02 task is \"user.model.ts — email (unique, required, lowercase, trimmed), passwordHash (required), name (required), timestamps. Pre-save hook or utility to hash passwords with bcrypt.\" The plan should either (a) include creating a `spec.md` analogous to t01's spec.md as a preliminary step, or (b) explicitly state that the task scope is derived from the milestone spec Phase 2, deliverable #2, citing the exact source.\n\nEverything else is sound: bcryptjs choice, standalone hash/verify functions (correctly opting for utility functions over pre-save hooks), schema field definitions with lowercase/trim transforms, contracts, verification commands, deferred testing to t08, and the decision not to re-export from index.ts."}
