{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan is solid overall — well-structured, follows codebase conventions, and makes sound technical decisions. However, two issues need to be addressed before locking:\n\n1. **Conversational preamble on line 1**: The file starts with \"Now I have the complete picture. Let me produce the implementation plan.\" — this is leftover agent chatter, not plan content. Remove it so the file starts cleanly with the `# Task t02` heading.\n\n2. **Shared package source files don't exist on this branch**: The plan states it depends on \"`User` interface from `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts`\" (Section 2, \"Existing Code Used\"), but `packages/shared/src/` does not exist on the current branch — only compiled output in `packages/shared/dist/` is present. The plan's `UserDocument` interface is self-contained and doesn't actually import from shared (the implementation code has no such import), so this dependency statement is misleading. Either:\n   - (a) Clarify that the shared `User` interface is used only as a *design reference* (not an import), and the `UserDocument` extends Mongoose `Document` independently, OR\n   - (b) If the intent is to actually import from `@taskboard/shared`, add that import to the implementation code and verify the package resolves correctly on this branch.\n\n   Option (a) is recommended since the implementation code shown does not import from shared.\n\nEverything else is sound: bcryptjs choice, standalone hash/verify functions, schema field definitions, contracts, verification commands, and deferred testing to t08 are all correct and well-justified."}
