{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec: `packages/server/src/db.ts` exports `connectDb`/`disconnectDb` using `mongoose`, reads `config.mongodbUri`, logs-and-rethrows connection failures, and `packages/server/src/index.ts` re-exports both functions. `npm install mongoose -w @taskboard/server`, `npm run build -w @taskboard/server`, and `npm run test -w @taskboard/server` pass. Security review found no new OWASP-top-10 issues in the implemented module; URI exposure in success logs is avoided.","issues":[]}
