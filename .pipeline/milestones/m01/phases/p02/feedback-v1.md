{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"**BLOCKING: The draft file contains meta-commentary, not an actual specification.**\n\nThe file `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p02/spec-v1.md` is 14 lines of summary text (\"The phase specification is ready. Here's a summary of what it covers...\") followed by a bullet-point outline. It is NOT a specification document — it is a description of a specification that was never written to the file. This is the same recurring failure mode seen in the milestone spec iterations and phase 1 spec iterations.\n\n**What the draft must contain (as an actual document, not commentary about one):**\n\n1. **Goal section** — restating the phase objective (can draw from the seed spec)\n\n2. **Scope section** (In-Scope / Out-of-Scope) — what this phase delivers and what it explicitly does not\n\n3. **Ordered task list with full detail for each task** — The summary mentions 8 tasks but provides only one-line descriptions. Each task needs:\n   - A clear title and description of what it delivers\n   - Specific file paths to create or modify\n   - Exact field definitions, validation rules, and index specifications (per-model)\n   - Dependencies on other tasks within this phase\n   - A concrete completion gate (testable condition)\n\n4. **Dependencies section** — prerequisites (Phase 1 complete, MongoDB running, etc.), environment variables, package dependencies to install\n\n5. **Exit criteria** — the summary claims \"9 exit criteria, all measurable\" but none are listed in the file. These must be written out explicitly with specific commands and expected outcomes, mapped to the milestone exit criteria (MP-3: all models CRUD, MP-4: seed user created, MP-10: all tests pass).\n\n6. **Artifact inventory** — the summary claims \"18 artifacts (13 new files, 2 modified)\" but none are listed. Every file to be created or modified must be enumerated.\n\n7. **Technical decisions** — bcryptjs vs bcrypt choice, test database strategy, password hashing approach (pre-save hook vs utility function), etc.\n\n**In short:** Rewrite the entire file as a standalone specification document. Do not include any preamble, summary commentary, or requests for write permission. The document must be self-contained — a reader should be able to implement the phase from this document alone without needing to reference the summary."}
