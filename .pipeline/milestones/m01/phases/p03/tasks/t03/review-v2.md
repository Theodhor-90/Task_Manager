{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Verified deliverables exist and conform: `auth.routes.ts` implements `POST /api/auth/login` and `GET /api/auth/me` with correct response/error contracts, `app.ts` registers routes under `/api/auth`, and `auth.routes.test.ts` covers the planned 8 integration cases (plus stronger invalid-input checks). Verification commands passed for tests (`npm run test -w packages/server`, 69/69) and type/build check (`npx tsc --noEmit -p packages/server/tsconfig.json`). No new OWASP-relevant security issues were found in this implementation (generic auth failure messaging, no sensitive data leakage, protected `/me`, input type guard prevents malformed-body misuse). Live `npm run dev`/curl validation is sandbox-blocked by port bind `EPERM`, not an implementation defect."  ,"issues":[]}
