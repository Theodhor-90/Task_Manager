The plan is **approved**. All assumptions were verified against the actual codebase:

- The implementation is fully specified with complete code for all 3 deliverables
- All dependencies (JWT plugin, auth middleware, models, test helpers) are confirmed in place
- The 8 test cases cover all 6 verification criteria from the task spec
- No contradictions with the master plan, milestone spec, or phase spec
- Follows existing codebase conventions (`app.inject()`, Vitest, named exports, kebab-case files)
- No over-engineering — stays within task scope
