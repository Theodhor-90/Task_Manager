{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"Implementation is close, but it does not fully satisfy the locked plan/spec input-validation requirements. Tests and build pass, but login request validation has a functional gap that can return 500 instead of 400 for missing credentials and does not enforce the `LoginRequest` string shape.","issues":[{"file":"packages/server/src/routes/auth.routes.ts","description":"`POST /login` destructures `request.body` directly (`const { email, password } = request.body as ...`). When body is absent, this throws and returns 500 (`Cannot destructure property 'email'...`) instead of the required 400 `{ error: \"Email and password are required\" }` for missing fields."},{"file":"packages/server/src/routes/auth.routes.ts","description":"Validation does not enforce `LoginRequest` shape (`email` and `password` as strings). Current truthy check allows non-string values through initial validation, which is not compliant with the spec requirement that login input be validated per `LoginRequest` and increases malformed-input/injection risk."}]}
