{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Verified deliverables D1–D5 are present and correct (`jwt.plugin.ts`, `cors.plugin.ts`, `config.ts`, `app.ts`, `app.test.ts`), async `buildApp()` call sites were updated (`server.ts`, tests), and `fastify-plugin` is now a direct dependency. Verification commands passed: `npm run test -w packages/server` (56/56), `npx tsc --noEmit -p packages/server/tsconfig.json` (pass), and runtime behavior confirms JWT/CORS wiring including `request.jwtVerify()` availability. `npm run dev` reaches app startup but cannot bind to `0.0.0.0:3001` in this sandbox (`EPERM`), which is an environment restriction, not an implementation defect. No new OWASP-top-10 class vulnerabilities were introduced by these changes." , "issues":[]}
