{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"**1. `fastify-plugin` must be declared as a direct dependency — treat as mandatory, not conditional.**\n\nIn Section 8 (\"Pre-Implementation Check\") and Section 6 step 1, the plan frames `fastify-plugin` installation as a conditional check: \"If not installed, run...\". However, `fastify-plugin` is NOT in `packages/server/package.json` — it is only present as a transitive dependency of `@fastify/cors` and `@fastify/jwt`. Importing a transitive dependency directly is fragile: a minor version bump of either package could change its dependency tree and break the build.\n\n**Fix**: Move `npm install fastify-plugin -w packages/server` into the Implementation Order as a mandatory first step (not a conditional check). Also add `fastify-plugin` to the Dependencies table in Section 2 with status \"Needs install\" instead of only listing already-installed packages. Remove the conditional phrasing in Section 8 — it should be a definitive action.\n\nEverything else in the plan is solid — no other issues found."}
