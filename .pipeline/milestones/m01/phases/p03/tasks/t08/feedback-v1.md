**Verdict: Approved**

The plan is ready to lock. It is comprehensive, correctly scoped as a verification/cleanup task, accurately reflects the current codebase state (all `app.ts` imports verified as active), maps all 13 phase exit criteria to specific verification steps, and introduces no unnecessary work. The implementation order is logical and the commands are concrete and executable.
