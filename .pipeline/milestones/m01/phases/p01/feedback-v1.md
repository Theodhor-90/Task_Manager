{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The draft is not ready to lock. The file `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/spec-v1.md` is meta-commentary (\"ready to be written\", \"grant write permission\") rather than a standalone phase spec.\n\nActionable fixes:\n1. Replace conversational/meta text with the actual specification document content.\n2. Include explicit phase sections at minimum: Goal, In-Scope/Out-of-Scope, ordered Tasks, Dependencies, Exit Criteria.\n3. Make each task independently plannable with concrete outputs (exact files/scripts/configs to create/update) and clear dependency order.\n4. Make exit criteria measurable with command-level checks (e.g., `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm run test`) and expected outcomes.\n5. Add/retain architectural decisions with rationale (workspace/package naming, TS strict setup, dev orchestration choice) so implementation does not require guessing intent.\n\nScope appears broadly aligned with Phase 1 intent, but the current draft format is the blocker."}
