{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"Two issues need to be resolved before locking:\n\n1. **`tsc -b` is incompatible with `noEmit: true`** — The build script is `\"tsc -b && vite build\"` but the tsconfig has `noEmit: true`. TypeScript's build mode (`-b`) ignores the `noEmit` flag and requires either `composite: true` or project references to function. As written, it will either error or emit unexpected `.js` files into the source tree. Fix: change the build script to `\"tsc --noEmit && vite build\"` (standard `tsc` with `--noEmit` for type-checking only), or alternatively set up `composite: true` with an `outDir` and remove `noEmit`. The plan's claim that \"`tsc -b` (build mode) respects project references and is the Vite-recommended approach for type checking\" is incorrect in this context — Vite's docs recommend `tsc -b` for projects using project references with composite mode, not for standalone type-checking with `noEmit`.\n\n2. **Verification command #13 will fail** — `timeout 5 npx vite --config packages/client/vite.config.ts` runs Vite from the repo root, but Vite resolves `index.html` relative to `root` (defaults to CWD). Since `index.html` is in `packages/client/`, not the repo root, Vite will fail to find it. Fix: change to `timeout 5 npm run dev -w @taskboard/client 2>&1 || true` or explicitly set `root` in the vite config.\n\nMinor note (non-blocking): The task spec says tsconfig should extend `tsconfig.base.json`. The plan's decision not to extend it is technically sound and well-justified, but the plan should explicitly acknowledge this is a deviation from the spec deliverable #2 text (\"extending `tsconfig.base.json`\") rather than presenting it as the natural approach."}
