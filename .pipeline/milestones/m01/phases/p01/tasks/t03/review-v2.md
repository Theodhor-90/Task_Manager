{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. All required scaffold files are present (plus a valid `src/index.ts` re-export entrypoint), TypeScript build and typecheck succeed, workspace/package checks pass, and Vitest runs successfully with no tests (as expected for this scaffold). Security review found no new OWASP-critical issues in this phase; only the expected dev fallback `JWT_SECRET`, which should be overridden in production. Note: direct listen/start verification is blocked in this sandbox (`EPERM` on socket/pipe), but code structure for startup is correct."  , "issues":[]}
