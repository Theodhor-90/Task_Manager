{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan is thorough and well-structured, but has the following issues that need to be addressed before locking:\n\n1. **`import Fastify from \"fastify\"` — likely incompatible with `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`**. The base tsconfig has `verbatimModuleSyntax: true`. Fastify 5 ships with TypeScript types that export `fastify` as a named export. With `verbatimModuleSyntax`, a default import like `import Fastify from \"fastify\"` will likely produce a TS error because the emitted JS must match the import syntax exactly. Verify the correct import form — it may need to be `import { fastify } from \"fastify\"` or `import fastify from \"fastify\"` depending on how Fastify 5's ESM exports are declared. The plan should document which import form is correct and why, ideally by referencing Fastify 5's actual `exports` field or type declarations.\n\n2. **Missing `@taskboard/shared` as explicit dependency in `package.json`**. The plan states: \"No `@taskboard/shared` dependency listed — npm workspaces automatically resolves sibling packages.\" This is incorrect. While npm workspaces makes sibling packages *available* for linking, TypeScript's `Node16` module resolution requires the package to be resolvable via `node_modules`. The root `dev` script already references `@taskboard/server`. The `@taskboard/shared` package's `tsconfig.json` and the path aliases in `tsconfig.base.json` help IDE resolution, but the actual workspace dependency `\"@taskboard/shared\": \"*\"` (or `\"workspace:*\"`) should be listed to ensure `npm install` creates the proper symlink. The plan acknowledges this might be needed but defers it. Since later tasks will import from `@taskboard/shared`, add it now to avoid a broken import path.\n\n3. **Root `dev` script will fail**. The root `package.json` has: `\"dev\": \"concurrently ... \\\"npm run dev -w @taskboard/server\\\" \\\"npm run dev -w @taskboard/client\\\"\"`. Since `packages/client/` doesn't exist yet, `npm run dev` from root will fail with `--kill-others-on-fail`. The plan should note this as a known limitation and document that `npm run dev -w @taskboard/server` should be used directly for verification (step 10), not `npm run dev` from root. Currently the verification commands don't call root `dev`, which is good, but the plan should explicitly call this out since task spec verification criterion #2 (from the phase) says \"Running the server dev script starts Fastify.\"\n\n4. **`supertest` version mismatch risk**. The plan specifies `supertest: ^7.0.0` and `@types/supertest: ^6.0.0`. Supertest v7 may have moved to built-in TypeScript types or have a different types contract. Verify that `@types/supertest@^6` is compatible with `supertest@^7`, or whether `@types/supertest` is even needed for v7. If supertest 7 includes its own types, the `@types/supertest` dependency should be removed to avoid type conflicts.\n\n5. **Vitest `globals: true` without TypeScript types**. The plan sets `globals: true` in vitest.config.ts so `describe`/`it`/`expect` are available without imports. However, TypeScript won't know about these globals unless the tsconfig includes `\"types\": [\"vitest/globals\"]` in `compilerOptions`. Since the server tsconfig only includes `src/`, test files may be compiled separately or not at all, but any test files written later will get TS errors. The plan should either (a) add a note that a separate `tsconfig.test.json` or vitest type reference will be needed, or (b) drop `globals: true` and use explicit imports (`import { describe, it, expect } from \"vitest\"`), which is simpler and avoids this issue entirely. Since this is a scaffold task and test files come later, explicitly noting this as a deferred decision is acceptable, but the current plan is silent on it.\n\nAll other aspects of the plan are solid — the implementation order, directory stubs, config module, app factory pattern, verification commands, and contract documentation are well done. Fix the above issues and the plan is ready to lock."}
