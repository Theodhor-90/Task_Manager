{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan is well-structured and thoroughly addresses all v1 feedback, but has two issues that need resolution before locking:\n\n1. **Missing `packages/server/src/index.ts` from the deliverables table and implementation details.** The file exists in the codebase and serves as the barrel export referenced by `package.json`'s `exports` field (`\"./dist/index.js\"`). The `package.json` specifies `\"main\": \"./dist/index.js\"` and `\"types\": \"./dist/index.d.ts\"` — both of which are produced by compiling `src/index.ts`. Without documenting this file, the plan has a contradiction: the `package.json` in Section 3.1 references `dist/index.js` but no source file produces it. Add `packages/server/src/index.ts` to the deliverables table (Action: Verify), include its content in Section 3 with a brief rationale (barrel export for the package's public API), and add a verification check in Section 5 confirming the file exists and re-exports `buildApp`, `config`, and `Config`.\n\n2. **`passWithNoTests: true` silently dropped from `vitest.config.ts`.** The current file has `passWithNoTests: true` alongside `globals: true`. The plan proposes removing `globals: true` (with good rationale) but also silently removes `passWithNoTests: true` without mentioning it. Since no test files exist in this scaffold task, running `npm run test -w @taskboard/server` (i.e., `vitest run`) will **fail** without `passWithNoTests: true` because Vitest exits with a non-zero code when it finds zero test files. This matters because: (a) the root `npm run test` script iterates over workspaces, and (b) the task spec's verification criterion #5 says \"Vitest configuration is present and loadable\" — a config that causes `vitest run` to fail on zero tests is arguably not correctly configured for a scaffold. Either preserve `passWithNoTests: true` in the proposed config and document why, or explicitly note that it's being removed and explain that `vitest run` will fail until test files are added (and update verification step 5 accordingly)."}
