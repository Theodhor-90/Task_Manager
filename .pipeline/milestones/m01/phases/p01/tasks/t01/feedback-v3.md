{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`plan-v3.md` is not an implementation plan; it is meta-commentary claiming a plan exists elsewhere. It is not lock-ready.\n\nRequired revisions:\n1. Replace `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t01/plan-v3.md` with a concrete, self-contained plan that includes exact target contents for `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, and `.gitignore` (plus any required workspace stub files, if intended).\n2. Provide ordered implementation steps with explicit file-by-file actions and exact script commands (`dev`, `build`, `test`) required by `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t01/spec.md`.\n3. Add a verification section mapping each task-spec verification criterion to concrete commands and expected results.\n4. Remove all process chatter/permission text; the document must be executable from content alone with no guesswork.\n5. Resolve upstream spec hygiene: both `.pipeline/milestones/m01/spec-locked.md` and `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/spec-locked.md` are also meta-commentary instead of locked specs, which creates contradiction/risk for downstream planning and should be corrected before locking."}
