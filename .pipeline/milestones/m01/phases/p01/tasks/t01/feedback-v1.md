{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"1. `tsconfig.base.json` is missing required path aliases for cross-package imports, and the plan explicitly says to omit them. This contradicts the task spec deliverable; define exact aliases (for example shared/server/client) and include a verification check for them.\n2. The plan introduces scope not requested by the task: modifying `tsconfig.json`, renaming package `name` to `taskboard`, renaming existing root scripts to `pipeline:*`, and creating `packages/.gitkeep`. Either remove these or justify each as required by spec/phase constraints.\n3. The `dev` script assumes future workspace package names (`@taskboard/server`, `@taskboard/client`) that are not defined in this task, creating guesswork. Specify a non-guess implementation tied to known paths/conventions.\n4. Test coverage is incomplete against exit criteria: it does not verify that `dev` includes `--kill-others-on-fail`, and it does not verify path-alias configuration.\n5. Milestone and phase “locked” docs currently read as meta-commentary placeholders, not executable specs. The plan should explicitly anchor to concrete requirements that are actually locked, otherwise contradiction checks cannot be fully validated."}
