I’m blocked by missing inputs: these files do not exist in the workspace right now (including `.pipeline/`):

- `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t01/plan-locked.md`
- `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t01/review-v2.md`
- `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t01/spec.md`

I also searched the parent project tree and didn’t find them.

Please add those files (or share the correct paths). Once they’re available, I’ll implement every review fix and run the full verification commands.
