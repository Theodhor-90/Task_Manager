{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`plan-v2.md` is not an implementation plan; it is meta-commentary about prior feedback and a write-permission request. It is not lock-ready.\n\nActionable fixes required:\n1. Replace `plan-v2.md` with a concrete, executable plan (ordered steps) for this task, not a status summary.\n2. Specify exact target file contents for `package.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, and `.gitignore` (or precise patch-level directives) so implementation requires no guesswork.\n3. Include explicit script commands for `dev`, `build`, and `test`, including how `concurrently --kill-others-on-fail` is applied.\n4. Define exact TypeScript settings required by spec (strict mode, ES module config, ES2022+, and concrete `paths` aliases).\n5. Add full verification/test section mapping each task spec verification criterion to concrete checks/commands and expected results.\n6. Ensure the plan references locked specs directly and avoids assumptions from non-existent package names/paths unless validated by current repo conventions.\n7. Remove process chatter (e.g., permission issues, feedback tables) from the locked plan document; keep only implementation intent, scope, and validation."}
