{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"**BLOCKING: plan-v3.md contains no actual plan — it is meta-commentary about a plan.**\n\nThe file `plan-v3.md` is 19 lines of prose *describing* what a plan would contain and asking for write permission. It is not an implementation plan. This is the same failure mode that afflicted plan-v1 and plan-v2, and was explicitly called out in both feedback-v1 and feedback-v2.\n\nAn approvable plan must be a **self-contained, executable document** — not a summary of one. Specifically, the plan file must contain:\n\n1. **Current State** — What exists after t01 (exact files with key config values from the actual repo).\n\n2. **Out of Scope** — What this task will NOT touch.\n\n3. **Ordered implementation steps** with **exact file contents** for each of the 5 deliverables:\n   - `packages/shared/package.json` — full JSON with name, version, type, main, types, exports, scripts\n   - `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` — full JSON extending base, with outDir/rootDir/composite settings\n   - `packages/shared/src/types/index.ts` — complete TypeScript source with all 7 entity interfaces (User, Project, Board, Column, Task, Comment, Label), API contract types (LoginRequest, LoginResponse, ApiError, ApiSuccess envelope), and Priority union type\n   - `packages/shared/src/constants/index.ts` — complete TypeScript source with PRIORITIES and DEFAULT_COLUMNS\n   - `packages/shared/src/index.ts` — barrel export file\n\n4. **Design decisions** documented inline (e.g., why `string` for ObjectId fields, `.js` extensions for Node16, `export type` for verbatimModuleSyntax compliance).\n\n5. **Verification checks** — concrete commands that map to each of the 5 verification criteria in the task spec.\n\n**Action required:** Write the actual plan content into the file. Do not write a summary or request write permission — write the plan itself."}
