{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Verified `packages/shared` scaffold files, exports, types, constants, and barrel wiring; all locked-plan verification commands passed (`npm install`, package build, strict typecheck, dist artifact checks, workspace resolution, and assertion scripts). No OWASP Top 10 risks were introduced in this type/constants-only package. Note: `npm audit` could not run due restricted network access, but code-level security review found no issues.","issues":[]}
