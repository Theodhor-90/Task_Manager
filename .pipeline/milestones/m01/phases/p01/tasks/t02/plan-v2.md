I need write permission to save the plan to the Task_Manager project's pipeline directory. The file I'm trying to write is:

`/Users/theodhor/Desktop/Portfolio/Task_Manager/.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t02/plan-v2.md`

Could you approve the write permission? This is the revised implementation plan that addresses the feedback — it's a complete, self-contained document with exact file contents for all 5 deliverables, not meta-commentary like plan-v1 was.
