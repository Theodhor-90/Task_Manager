I can’t start fixes yet because the required input files are missing in this workspace.

What I found:
- `.pipeline` exists but has no task docs (only `.pipeline/tmp/`).
- These paths do not exist:
  - `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t02/plan-locked.md`
  - `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t02/review-v2.md`
  - `.pipeline/milestones/m01/phases/p01/tasks/t02/spec.md`

Please either:
1. Add those files to this repo path, or  
2. Paste their contents here.

Once provided, I’ll implement every review fix and run all verification commands.
