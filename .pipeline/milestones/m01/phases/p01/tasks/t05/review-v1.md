{"verdict":"approved","feedback":"Implementation matches the locked plan and task spec. Verified file-level changes are present and correct in `packages/server/package.json`, `packages/client/package.json`, `packages/server/src/app.ts`, `packages/client/src/App.tsx`, and `packages/server/vitest.config.ts`. Verification commands passed for install, dependency graph, per-workspace builds, full build, tests, and source assertions. Runtime health behavior was additionally confirmed via `app.inject()` (`200` with expected `defaultColumns`). No OWASP-relevant security issues were introduced by this scope (no new input handling/auth/session/database logic; only static shared imports and a basic health route). Note: exact socket/dev-process checks in the plan are constrained by sandbox EPERM/`timeout` availability, but code-level and injection-based runtime verification succeeded."  , "issues": []}
