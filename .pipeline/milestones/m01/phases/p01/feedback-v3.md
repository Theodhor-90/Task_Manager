{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`spec-v3.md` is not reviewable as a phase specification because it is still meta-commentary about an intended spec, not the spec itself. It must be replaced with a standalone document containing actual phase content. Required revisions:\n1. Replace the current text with explicit sections and substantive content: Goal, In-Scope, Out-of-Scope, Ordered Tasks, Dependencies, Exit Criteria, Architectural Decisions, Risks.\n2. Provide concrete ordered tasks for Milestone 1 / Phase 1 only (monorepo + dev environment): root workspace setup, shared tsconfig, package scaffolds (`shared`, `server`, `client`), scripts, and verification.\n3. Ensure task dependency order is implementable (workspace/bootstrap first, then package scaffolds, then cross-package wiring, then verification).\n4. Define measurable exit criteria aligned to milestone boundaries (e.g., `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, strict TS compile, shared imports resolve). Avoid criteria requiring DB/auth implementation in this phase.\n5. Remove claims like “complete code for every file” unless those files and contents are actually present in this document.\n6. Add explicit architectural decisions and rationale relevant to this phase only (workspaces, strict TS, tooling choices), and avoid introducing scope beyond M1/P1.\n7. Eliminate any permission/request language and status-report phrasing; the file must read as the definitive spec to lock."}
