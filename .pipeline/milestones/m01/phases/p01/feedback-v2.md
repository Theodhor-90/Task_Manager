{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`spec-v2.md` is not a phase specification yet; it is meta-commentary asking for write permission. It is missing the actual content needed to lock the phase.\n\nRequired fixes before approval:\n1. Replace the current text with a complete standalone phase spec document (not a status note).\n2. Include explicit sections: Goal, In-Scope, Out-of-Scope, Ordered Tasks, Dependencies, Exit Criteria, Architectural Decisions, Risks.\n3. Define concrete tasks with implementation-ready detail (files, scripts, config values, expected outputs), and ensure dependency order is clear.\n4. Make exit criteria measurable with exact commands and pass/fail expectations.\n5. Ensure scope strictly matches Milestone 1 / Phase 1 (monorepo + dev environment) and does not drift into later DB/auth implementation.\n6. Add enough detail to plan without guessing (current draft provides claims about changes, but no actual spec body to execute)."}
