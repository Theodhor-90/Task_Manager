{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"`spec-v2.md` is not lock-ready because it is not a milestone spec document yet; it is a meta note about prior edits.\n\nActionable fixes:\n1. Replace `.pipeline/milestones/m01/spec-v2.md` with an actual specification (Goal, Scope, Phases, Exit Criteria, Dependencies, Assumptions), not commentary.\n2. Keep scope strictly aligned to Milestone 1 in `MASTER_PLAN.md` section 7: monorepo/workspaces + TS/tooling, Mongo/Mongoose models + seed user, JWT login/auth middleware + client login/auth guard.\n3. Provide phase-by-phase deliverables that are independently completable and ordered (environment -> data/models -> auth).\n4. Define measurable exit criteria that map to the 6 master-plan exits (commands/endpoints/observable outcomes), and clearly label any extras as non-blocking.\n5. Explicitly list prerequisites/dependencies (Node/npm workspace setup, MongoDB availability, env vars/secrets, package interdependencies).\n6. Remove ambiguity by naming concrete validation targets for protected-route auth checks (if using `GET /api/auth/me`, state it clearly as part of milestone scope and verification).\n\nCurrent checklist assessment:\n- Scope alignment: cannot verify (no executable spec content)\n- Phase breakdown: missing\n- Exit criteria: missing\n- Completeness: insufficient\n- Over-engineering: not assessable\n- Dependencies: missing\n- Ambiguity: high"}
