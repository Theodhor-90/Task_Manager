{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"Blocking issue: `.pipeline/milestones/m01/spec-v3.md` is not an actual milestone spec draft; it is process commentary about write access and a feedback summary. Because of that, the draft is not lock-ready.\n\nRequired revisions:\n1. Replace the file contents with a standalone specification document (not commentary), including at minimum: Goal, Scope, Phases, Exit Criteria, Dependencies, and Risks/Assumptions.\n2. Keep scope strictly to Milestone 1 in `MASTER_PLAN.md` (monorepo/dev environment, database/models + seed user, authentication). Do not introduce Milestone 2+ work.\n3. Provide phase breakdown as concrete, independently completable phase deliverables in logical order (Phase 1 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3).\n4. Define measurable exit criteria that directly map to all 6 Milestone 1 exit criteria in `MASTER_PLAN.md` (install, dev startup, model CRUD readiness, seed user creation, JWT/protected-route behavior, client login + redirect).\n5. State dependencies explicitly (tooling/runtime prerequisites, required services/env vars, and phase prerequisites).\n6. Remove ambiguous claims like \"complete when it works\"; each phase and criterion should have testable validation targets (commands/tests/endpoints and expected outcomes)."}
