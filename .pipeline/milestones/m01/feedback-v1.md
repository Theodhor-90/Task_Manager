{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"1) Remove non-spec conversational text from the draft (`spec-v1.md` line 1 and line 164). The document should contain only the milestone specification.\n2) Re-align lock criteria to the master-plan milestone boundaries: keep additional detail, but make extra requirements (e.g., full auth test matrix, dashboard/logout behavior details) explicitly non-blocking or move them to an implementation notes section. Current exit gates are stricter than the master milestone and may create scope creep.\n3) Clarify the protected-route validation target in Phase 3/Exit Criteria (which concrete protected endpoint is used to prove token enforcement), so implementation planning does not require guessing."}
