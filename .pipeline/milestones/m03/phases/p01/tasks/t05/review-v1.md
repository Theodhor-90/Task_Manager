{"feedback":"Implementation is complete and matches the locked plan exactly. All deliverables created, all tests pass (9/9 AppLayout tests, 59/59 total tests), TypeScript compiles successfully, no security vulnerabilities, and code follows existing conventions. The AppLayout component correctly combines Header, Sidebar, and Outlet with proper layout (Flexbox, fixed sidebar w-64, scrollable main content). Router structure properly nests authenticated routes inside ProtectedRoute → ProjectsProvider → AppLayout. Page title derivation from route works correctly. All verification commands passed.","verdict":"approved","issues":[]}
