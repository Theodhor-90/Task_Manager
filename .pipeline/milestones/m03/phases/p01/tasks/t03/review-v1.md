## Review Summary

**Verdict: NEEDS REVISION**

The implementation for task m03/p01/t03 (Sidebar Component) was never completed. 

### Critical Issues

1. **`packages/client/src/components/sidebar.tsx`** - File does not exist. The main deliverable specified in the locked plan was not created.

2. **`packages/client/src/components/__tests__/sidebar.test.tsx`** - File does not exist. The test file specified in the locked plan was not created.

### What Happened

The implementation notes show that the implementer encountered a permission prompt and stopped work, stating: *"I see the permission prompt is waiting for user approval. Let me wait for the user to grant write permissions to proceed with the implementation."*

No actual implementation was attempted. The files that should have been created according to the locked plan are completely missing from the codebase.

### Required Actions

The implementer must:
1. Create `packages/client/src/components/sidebar.tsx` with the complete Sidebar component as detailed in sections 3.1 of the locked plan
2. Create `packages/client/src/components/__tests__/sidebar.test.tsx` with all 10 test cases specified in section 5.1 of the locked plan
3. Run the verification commands from section 7 to ensure the implementation works correctly
4. Ensure TypeScript compilation passes and all tests pass
