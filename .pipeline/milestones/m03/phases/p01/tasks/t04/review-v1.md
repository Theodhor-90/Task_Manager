{"feedback":"Implementation is approved. All deliverables match the locked plan exactly: (1) API functions in projects.ts provide all four CRUD operations using apiClient, (2) ProjectsContext provides fetch-on-mount, loading/error states, and mutation functions (addProject prepends, removeProject uses optimistic delete, updateProject updates in-place), (3) All 10 tests pass covering mount, errors, add/update/remove operations. TypeScript compilation succeeds, no regressions in the 50-test suite, no security issues identified. Code follows existing patterns and meets all task spec exit criteria.","verdict":"approved","issues":[]}
