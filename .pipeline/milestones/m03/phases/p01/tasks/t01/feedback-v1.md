{"verdict":"needs_revision","feedback":"The plan includes a detailed test plan (Section 5) with 22 tests across 4 test files, but the client package has **no testing infrastructure installed**. Vitest, React Testing Library (`@testing-library/react`), `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `jsdom` are not in the client's `package.json`. There is no `vitest.config.ts` for the client package and no `test` script in its `package.json`.\n\n**Required additions to the plan:**\n\n1. **Add a \"Test Infrastructure Setup\" step** (should be the first item in Section 6 \"Implementation Order\", before writing any tests). This step must specify:\n   - Exact devDependencies to install: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom` (and their versions, matching the vitest `^3.0.0` used by server/shared packages).\n   - A `vitest.config.ts` file for the client package with `environment: \"jsdom\"` and appropriate settings (reference the existing server/shared vitest configs for consistency).\n   - A `test` script to add to `packages/client/package.json` (e.g., `\"test\": \"vitest run\"`).\n   - A test setup file if needed for `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers (e.g., `import \"@testing-library/jest-dom\"` in a setup file referenced by vitest config).\n\n2. **Add `vitest.config.ts` and `package.json` modifications to the Deliverables table** (Section 1) — currently only the 4 component files are listed. The test config files are deliverables too.\n\n3. **Update Verification Commands** (Section 7) — Step 4 assumes tests can just run. Add the dependency installation command (`npm install` from root after adding devDependencies) before the test run command.\n\nEverything else in the plan is solid — component specifications, interfaces, styling, accessibility, and test cases are all well-defined and consistent with the codebase."}
