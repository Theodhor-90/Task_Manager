The plan is **approved**. It's thorough, complete, and ready to lock. Key strengths:

- **Complete test infrastructure setup** added in v2 addresses the v1 feedback perfectly
- Every component has exact TypeScript interfaces, Tailwind classes, and behavioral specifications — zero guesswork needed
- 22 well-defined tests across 4 test files cover all task spec verification criteria
- Follows existing codebase conventions (naming, styling patterns, vitest configuration)
- No over-engineering — stays exactly within task scope
