The login page has been enhanced with LoadingSpinner during initial auth check, ErrorMessage component for dismissable error display, and LoadingSpinner in the submit button during authentication. All 12 tests pass, TypeScript compiles without errors, and no security vulnerabilities were introduced. The implementation exactly matches the locked plan with proper imports, component usage, and styling.","verdict":"approved","issues":[]}
