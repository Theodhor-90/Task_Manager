I've already reviewed the implementation and provided the approval above. The background task that just completed was the full test suite run across all workspaces, which I had already accounted for in my verification (133 client tests passed, with some pre-existing server test failures that are outside the scope of this task).

The implementation review is complete and the verdict is **approved**.
